React Basics: Components

What is a Component?
A component is a reusable piece of code in React, typically written as a JavaScript function.
It represents part of the user interface (UI), like a button, header, form, etc.
Components make it easier to build, manage, and reuse UI elements.

A website or app built with React usually consists of multiple components.
Components can be nested, meaning one component can include others.
Components help break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable pieces.
The architecture of a React app is often built around well-structured components.

Why React:

1. Plain JavaScript is manual and repetitive:
Without React, you'd need to manually update the DOM every time something changes 
(like text input, user action, etc.). This becomes hard to manage as your app grows.

2. React makes UI updates automatic:

React uses a virtual DOM, which efficiently updates only the parts of the page that changed.
This leads to faster and smoother performance.

3. Code is cleaner and reusable:
React lets you build apps using components, so your code is modular, reusable, and easier to manage.

4. Easier state management:
React makes it simple to manage data (called state) and keep the UI in sync with it.

5. Strong community and ecosystem:
Huge support, tools, and libraries available for fast development.
