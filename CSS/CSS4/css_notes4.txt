CSS 4:

Transistions 3D

Static: No transformation is applied, the element stays in its original 3D space.

Transform: Applies 3D effects like translateX, rotateY, requiring perspective to give depth.

Scaled: Enlarges or shrinks elements in 3D using functions like scaleZ, often combined with rotate.
