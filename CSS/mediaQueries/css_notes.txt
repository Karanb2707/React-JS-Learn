Media Queries

Media queries are CSS techniques used to apply styles based on device characteristics 
like screen width, height, resolution, or orientation. They help create responsive 
designs by adapting layouts to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop). 
Media queries use the @media rule followed by conditions. For example:
eg: @media (max-width: 768px) { body { font-size: 14px; } }


Nested Grid:

A nested grid is a CSS Grid layout where a grid item itself becomes a grid container, 
allowing you to create complex layouts by placing grids inside other grids.
