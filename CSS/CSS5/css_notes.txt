CSS 5 – FlexBox

FlexBox is a layout model to manage space and alignment within a container.
The parent is called flex container, and its children are flex items.

Main Axis: Horizontal (default) – elements align along this.

Cross Axis: Vertical – used for vertical alignment.

Properties:

flex-direction: Sets main axis direction
row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse

flex-wrap: Controls item wrapping
nowrap (default) – items shrink to fit
wrap – items move to next line
wrap-reverse – wrap in reverse order

flex-flow: Shorthand for flex-direction + flex-wrap

justify-content (horizontal alignment)
flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly

align-items (vertical alignment of items)
flex-start | flex-end | center

align-content (vertical alignment of lines – when multiple rows)
Same values as justify-content

Flex-item Properties:

order: Specifies the order of the flex items; lower values appear first.

flex-grow: Defines how much a flex item should grow relative to others when space is available.

flex-shrink: Determines how much a flex item should shrink relative to others when space is tight.

flex-basis: Sets the initial size of a flex item before any space distribution happens.

flex: A shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis combined in one line.
