CSS 5:

FlexBox:
FlexBox is layout model using that we can handle space distribution and alignment capabilities
There is parent container which is called 'flex' and all other elementes in it called 'flex-items'

In FlexBox the main axis is horizontal axis so elementes will align on horizontal axis

flex-wrap: wrap -> element moves on next line
flex-wrap: nowrap -> normal element size will reduce like according squeeze
flex-wrap: wrap reverse -> element moves on above line
