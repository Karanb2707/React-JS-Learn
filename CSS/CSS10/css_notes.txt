Animations:

Animation in CSS allows elements to transition between styles over time using keyframes. 
It enables smooth visual effects like movement, fading, or transformations without JavaScript.

properties:

animation-name: Specifies the name of the @keyframes (e.g., animation-name: slide;)
animation-duration: Sets how long the animation lasts (e.g., animation-duration: 2s;)
animation-timing-function: Controls the speed curve (e.g., animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;)
animation-delay: Delays the start (e.g., animation-delay: 1s;)
animation-iteration-count: Number of times to run (e.g., animation-iteration-count: infinite;)
animation-direction: Direction of animation (e.g., animation-direction: alternate;)
animation-fill-mode: Sets how styles are applied before/after (e.g., animation-fill-mode: forwards;)
animation-play-state: Pauses or runs animation (e.g., animation-play-state: paused;)
animation: Shorthand for all (e.g., animation: slide 2s ease-in-out 1s infinite alternate forwards;)
